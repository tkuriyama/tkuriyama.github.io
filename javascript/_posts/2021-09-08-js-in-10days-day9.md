Today's plan is to complete the [MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started) on creating a Todo app in React, and start adding some features. My intent is to create more of a shopping list that can track wishlist and purchased items with urls, persisted in local storage. 

## MDN Tutorial: Todo App in React

[Day 9 Code](https://github.com/tkuriyama/learn-js/tree/master/moz-todo-react)

As of [this commit](https://github.com/tkuriyama/learn-js/commit/26d312370f63db95e52f3ea5342c9d170484d3b9), the tutorial is complete.

Again, not much to note as everything is clearly explained and works. IT looks like this:

![Todo App](/assets/img/mdn_todo_list.png){:class="img-responsive"}

(The one part of the tutorial I didn't read closely was the CSS, which seems like it's developed into a language in itself, with some powerful features.)


## Functional Additions

**Local Storage**


Changing the React app to use `localStorage` instead of a hard-coded initial state turns out to be straightforward. [This article](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/) provides a nice function that nicely wraps the `useState` hook.

Since I don't plan to store much data in the app, and it's for unimportant data even if I end up using it regularly, I'm not concerned with the potential issues with using the browser's local storage.

**Minor UI / UX Changes**

- style updates
- pre-load existing value when editing
