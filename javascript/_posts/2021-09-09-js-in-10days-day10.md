Today's plan is to finish up some functional additions to the shopping list tracker and write a review post of the past ten days. 


## Functional Additions to React App

[Day 10 Code](https://github.com/tkuriyama/learn-js/tree/master/moz-todo-react)

**Edit Ergonomics**

When editing a text input field, there should be a placeolder for hte current value, which can be auto-filled for editing by pressing tab. Otherwise, the user inputs a complete new value.

```javascript
    function tryAutofill(e) {
        if (e.target.value === "" && e.keyCode === 9) {
            e.preventDefault();
            const text =
                e.target.placeholder.split(" (press")[0]
            e.target.value = text;
            setNewName(e.target.placeholder);
        }
    }
```

**Status Toggle**

Instead of `completed` boolean task status, each item in the shopping list should be associated with a status name (string, logically of union type though not implemented as such here):

```javascript
    // checkbox
    function toggleTaskStatus(id, statusName) {
        const updatedTasks = tasks.map(task => {
            if (task.id !== id) {
                return task;
            } else {
                return {...task, statusName: statusName};
            }
        });
        setTasks(updatedTasks);
        }
```

**Cosmetic Updates**

After some minor cosmetic updates to reduce unnecessary text, the app looks like this:

![Todo App](/assets/img/mdn_todo_list2.png){:class="img-responsive"}

I started to add a URL input component, then spent a long time unsuccessfully trying to understand how the CSS width and element positioning works in the `index.css` stylesheet. It seems silly to get stuck on the "simple" presentation layer, but I concluded that without a deeper undertanding of modern CSS, the point of dimishing return was reached as far as experimenting blindly with the obvious elements like `width`, `max-width`, `display`, etc.

While I'm adding a CSS primer to my future todo list, it also really emphasized to me just how nice the Elm UI library `elm-ui` is, in terms of abstracting away the HTML layout and CSS layers, and presenting the user a pure Elm API that is intuitive and "just works" (for the most part).


## Wrapping Up

While I feel like I learned a decent amount from the React tutorail and toy app, especially in terms of IO like localStorage and keyboard interactions, I still feel quite frustrated with the sluggish pace of developemnt and debugging.

To become more proficient on the front-end, it seems like a few things are imperative:

- reasonable proficiency in CSS
- solid understanding of the framework tooling, especially for testing, error handling, and generally getting helpful messages out of the compiler

This concludes my ten day journey learning JavaScript... a review post to follow.
