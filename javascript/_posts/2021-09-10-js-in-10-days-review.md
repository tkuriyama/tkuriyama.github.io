TLDR: there's a lot to learn in the JavaScript ecosystem, and ten days is not nearly enough; as Norvig said, it's more about [teaching yourself to program in ten years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html).

I recently set out to learn as much JavaScript as possible in 10 days. I've filtered the individual days' posts from the blog home, but they're all linked below.

[Day 1](https://tkuriyama.github.io/javascript/2021/08/31/js-in-7days-day1.html) | [Day2](https://tkuriyama.github.io/javascript/2021/09/01/js-in-7days-day2.html) | [Day 3](https://tkuriyama.github.io/javascript/2021/09/02/js-in-10days-day3.html) | [Day 4](https://tkuriyama.github.io/javascript/2021/09/03/js-in-10days-day4.html) | [Day 5](https://tkuriyama.github.io/javascript/2021/09/04/js-in-10days-day5.html)

[Day 6](https://tkuriyama.github.io/javascript/2021/09/05/js-in-10days-day6.html) | [Day 7](https://tkuriyama.github.io/javascript/2021/09/06/js-in-10days-day7.html) | [Day 8](https://tkuriyama.github.io/javascript/2021/09/07/js-in-10days-day8.html) | [Day 9](https://tkuriyama.github.io/javascript/2021/09/08/js-in-10days-day9.html) | [Day 10](https://tkuriyama.github.io/javascript/2021/09/09/js-in-10days-day10.html)


## Overview

At the end of ten days, I feel like I know less JavaScript than I expected. This might be because I have a bit more appreciation for; (a) the exntet of new language features and the speed of change; and (b) the scale of the ecosystem.

The path that I ended up taking in ten days is maybe indicative of the nature of JavaScript today. Struggling with version compatibitliy of new langauge features, working out instance vs prorotype issues in the TypeScript compiler, using a mature framework like React to build a toy app -- these are all part of learning JavaScript, because JavaScript today is comprised of so many different aspects.





## Key Materials Covered

The main materials covered were as follows, excluding miscellaneous articles and documentation.

**Books**

- Douglas Crockford, [JavaScript, the Good Parts](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-good/9780596517748/) (2008)
- Luis Atencio, [The Joy of JavaScript](https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-javascript?gclid=Cj0KCQjwm9yJBhDTARIsABKIcGba98tCJcy9VP5gCWyvsv8TlDeOGFtxaeGUgbPsTUPGn5fmDHeslZQaApWAEALw_wcB) (2021)
- Marijn Haverbeke [Eloquent Javascript](https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-javascript?gclid=Cj0KCQjwm9yJBhDTARIsABKIcGba98tCJcy9VP5gCWyvsv8TlDeOGFtxaeGUgbPsTUPGn5fmDHeslZQaApWAEALw_wcB) (2018)

**Videos**

- Brandon Eich, [A Brief History of JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxouWy-ZE80)

**Tutorials / References**

- [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- Eric Elliott, [The Missing Introduction to React](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-missing-introduction-to-react-62837cb2fd76)
- MDN, [Getting Started with React](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started)

## Thoughts on Materials

My perspective remains quite limited, but...

- I'd recommend unequivocally the MDN tutorail on React, as well as the other materials in their [Learn Web Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) series.

- The TypeScript handbook is quite good as far as offical documentation goes, though it's probably worth finding longer mateiral dedicated to learning TypeScript.

- As far as books, I'd look for the latest recommendations, given how fast the language is evolving. I'd probably not recommend the Crockford, given that it's become relatively dated. For more advanced programmers, the Atencio is interesting and will likely remain relevant for a while.



## Wrapping Up
