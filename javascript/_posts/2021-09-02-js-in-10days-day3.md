Today's plan is to make more progress on Atencio.

## Setting up eslint

To get  `eslint` to work with `flycheck` in emacs, I needed a few more steps.

Install `eslint` globally: `npm install -g eslint`.

At first emacs threw cryptic errors, and it turned out that `eslint` was the source. To use the JoJ [`.eslintrc` file](https://github.com/tkuriyama/learn-js/blob/master/joj/.eslintrc), run `eslint` on a sample file and install the necessary dependenceis from the `.eslintrc` file based on the errors. For me, it was:

```node
npm install --save-dev babel-eslint 
 npm install eslint-plugin-flowtype@latest --save-dev
vnpm install eslint-plugin-fp@latest --save-dev
```

Then, disable `js2-mode` checkers and use `eslint` with `flycheck` instead:

```lisp
 (setq js2-mode-show-parse-errors nil)
 (setq js2-mode-show-strict-warnings nil)
 (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook
           #'js2-imenu-extras-mode)
 (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook
          (defun my-js2-mode-setup ()
            (flycheck-mode t)
            (when (executable-find "eslint")
              (flycheck-select-checker 'javascript-eslint))))
```

See the [updated elisp config file](https://gist.github.com/tkuriyama/9dc372fdf7069744e3def37a6c8f8087).

Interestingly, `esiint` often shows one or two errors when I copy-paste Atencio's code, but none of them cause Babel compilation or runtime issues, and I don't know nearly enough JS to opine further.


## Day 3 Talks / Articles

The first video that came up when searching for Kyle Simpson was ["Mo'Problems Mo'Nads -- City JS Conf 2020"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKJPwRLQwsA) (maybe because of my search history on mondads..?)

A decent talk, but there are probably better articulartions of the motivation for using monads. I remember [this post](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2011/03/05/translation-from-haskell-to-javascript-of-selected-portions-of-the-best-introduction-to-monads-ive-ever-read/) was useful for talking about intro to monads with JavaScript folks. 


## JoJ

**Chapter 3 Linked, compositional object models**

"Objects Linked to Other Objects" (OLOO)

- Using `Object.create()` and an `init()` function to encapsulate private state
- Clear management of the object context up the chain of objects
- No boilerplate code as with classes or constructor functions

Object.assign()

- for existing properties, uses [[Set]] (so an object setter `set` can be used); for new properites, uses the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal process
- can use defaults for unspecified fields

Assembling objects using mixin composition

- Assiging with multiple objects (potentially using the spread operator for syntax)
- Each mixin should be self-contained and simple, to be composed together with other such objects
- aka "dynamic concatenation"
- with classes, Object.assing() extends the class's prototype dynamically
- Object.assign() has LIFO precedence (right-most first), avoiding ambiguity / resolution conflicts if there are multiple implemnetations in the mixins
- Note - mixins bind tightly to the public interface, and the shape of the join is not very obvious


## JoJ Code

[Day 3 Code](https://github.com/tkuriyama/learn-js/tree/master/joj/day3)

I mostly copy-pasted JoJ code into files, looked at the `eslint` errors if present, and added some `console.log`s to get some output.

Note that the `day3/src/txn2.js` file is incomplete and won't compile with `npx babel`.


## Other Code

[Day 3 Code](https://github.com/tkuriyama/learn-js/tree/master/snippets/day3)

Building on yesterday's `fold`, here is `flatten` implemented with `foldR` (a fairly expensive operation with this implementation):

```typescript
function toArrayHelper<T>(xs: ConsList<T>, arr: Array<T>): Array<T> {
    if (xs === null) {
        return arr;
    }
    else {
        let [h, t] = xs
        arr.push(h);
        return toArrayHelper(t, arr);
    }
}

function concat<T>(xs: ConsList<T>, ys: ConsList<T>): ConsList<T> {
    if (xs === null) {
        return ys;
    }
    else {
        let [h, t] = xs
        return cons(h, concat(t, ys));
    }
}

function flatten<T>(xss: ConsList<ConsList<T>>): ConsList<T> {
    return foldR((a, b) => concat(a, b), empty as ConsList<T>, xss);
}
```

Testing the result with `xs, ys, zs` as inputs `[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]`...

```typescript
const nested = fromArray([xs, ys, zs]) as ConsList<ConsList<number>>;
console.log('Flatten |> toArray', toArray(flatten(nested)));
```

The result looks good:

```shell
% tsc && node fold.js
Flatten |> toArray [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
```


## Wrapping Up

Atencio's book is one of the better programming books I've read, insofar as (1) all the code I've tried so far works (2) there is the right amonut of detail, with links to further reading (3) there is a story and motivating example that runs throughout.

I'd probably get more out of it if I knew a bit more JavaScript, but it's still digestible (and the motivating example happens to be something I've worked on recently -- a toy blockchain implementation).

If anything is missing, maybe it's exercises or further questions for readers to ponder, but that may be more of a stylistic choice (i.e. it's just not that kind of a book).


## Todo / To Read
- [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder _pattern)
- More chapters of  Atencio
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) has exercises at the end of chapters, which might be worth exploring
- Figure out how to use `outDir`(?) to compile `.js` files to separate subdirectory
- Compiling with both TypeScript with Babel
- Kyle Simpson, [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/1st-ed)
- Composing Software, by Eric Elliot (https:// leanpub.com/composingsoftware)
