Today's plan is to work through an Eloquent JavaScript chapter with the accompanying exercises. 

There are also some browser-based chapters in the same book, which look like they might have good exercises for building small apps.

## Eloquent JavaScript

[Day 5 Code](https://github.com/tkuriyama/learn-js/tree/master/snippets/day5)

The [Egg Programing Language exercise chapter](https://eloquentjavascript.net/12_language.html) from Eloquent JavaScript involves writing a parser and interpreter for a toy, Lisp-like programming language called Egg.

I used TypeScript, for which the initial work was mainly setting up the custom types / type aliases.

```typescript
type ParseResult =
    {
        expr: EggExpr,
        rest: string
    }

type EggExpr
    = ValueToken
    | WordToken
    | ApplyExpr


type ValueToken
    = { type: ValueType, value: Value }

type WordToken
    = { type: WordType, name: string }

type ApplyExpr
    = { type: ApplyType, operator: WordToken, args: Array<EggExpr> }


type ApplyType = "apply";
type ValueType = "value";
type WordType = "word";

type Value = number | string
```

The type literals are maybe unnecessary, but I wanted to try it as it's not a feature I've used in other statically typed languages.

**Exercises: Arrays**

The implementation of array is straightforward:

```typescript
topScope.array = (...vals: Array<Value>): Array<Value> => {
    return vals;
}

topScope.length = (arr: Array<Value>): number => {
    return arr.length;
}

topScope.element = (arr: Array<Value>, i: number): Value => {
    const val = arr[i];
    if (val === undefined) {
        throw new RangeError(`${i} is out of range of array ${arr}`);
    }
    return val;
};
```

Since there is no error or undefined in the Egg language, attempting to index out of range throws an error.

**Exercise: Comments**

Following the hint, single-line comments starting with `#` are ignored. In this case, there is a recursive call required after consuming a comment line. Maybe there is a simpler, regex-based way to avoid the additiomal recursive call, but this seems simple enough.

```typescript
function skipSpace(s: string): string {
    const firstChar = s.search(/\S/);
    if (firstChar == -1) {
        return "";
    } else {
        const s_ = s.slice(firstChar)
        if (s_[0] == '#') {
            return skipSpace(s_.slice(s_.search(/\n/) + 1));
        } else {
            return s_;
        }
    }
```

**Exercise: Fixing Scope and Adding a `set` operator**

`set` traverses scope upwards in search of a variable name that should exist (as opposed to `define`, which is intended for new variables.

```javascript

specialForms.set = (args: Array<EggExpr>, scope: object) => {
    if (args.length != 2 || args[0].type != "word") {
        throw new SyntaxError("Incorrect use of set");
    } else {
        const name = args[0].name;
        const val = evaluate(args[1], scope);

        while (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(scope, name)) {
            if (Object.getPrototypeOf(scope) === null) {
                throw new ReferenceError(`Could not find property ${name} to set with ${val}`);
            } else {
                scope = Object.getPrototypeOf(scope);
            }
        }
        scope[name] = val;
    }
};
```
Note that there's not test framework, so I'm just compiling and testing with a seris of `console.log` (and the `print` operator defined in Egg):

`tsc egg.ts && node egg.js`


## Wrapping Up

Today was another short day, given long weekend activities. The Eloquent JavaScript is on the simpler side (certainly compared to Atencio), but it's very clear and the exercises are helpful for my current level of JS. TypeScript didn't get in the way today, and was quite helpful in forcing some upfront thought as to the exact types being manipulated. It's hard to imagine coding without a live, reloading type checker...

In the remaining four days, I'm planning to work on the Eloquent Javascript browser-based and Node exercises, and maybe build something very simple like a todo list (by hand? with React or Vue?).


## Todo / To Read

- ~~More chapters of  Atencio~~
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) has exercises at the end of chapters, which might be worth exploring
- Figure out how to use `outDir`(?) to compile `.js` files to separate subdirectory
- Compiling with both TypeScript with Babel
- Kyle Simpson, [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/1st-ed)
