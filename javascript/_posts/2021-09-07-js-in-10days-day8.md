Today's plan is to follow the MDN tutorial on building a simple [tudo app in React](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started) -- a classic hello world exercise for the web.

MDN docs have been consistently the most clear as a JavaScript reference, and I've been interested in React since reading about it a few days prior.


## MDN Tutorial: Todo App in React

[Day 8 Code](https://github.com/tkuriyama/learn-js/tree/master/moz-todo-react)

Today's code includes the chapters from the begining through the first chapter on React interactivity. There's not much to add in terms of notes, as the tutorial is comprehensive and all the code works. 



## Wrapping Up

The MDN tutorial is **excellent** -- it is very clear and everything actually works (!). React is relatively appealing so far, as it seems to embrace purity in ways similar to Elm, making it easier to reason about code. The React (Node?) hot-reloading compiler is also helpful, though it is not as fast as Elm and doesn't seem to catch all potential run-time issues.

I'm curious about using TypeScript with React. With the remaining two days, my plan is to complete the tutorial and learn by adding more features (e.g. using the browser's local storage, adding more UI features, etc).


## Todo / To Read

- Using flycheck with React / web-mode / .jsx in emacs
- MDN accessibility: [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)
- Figure out how to use `outDir`(?) to compile `.js` files to separate subdirectory
- Compiling with both TypeScript with Babel
