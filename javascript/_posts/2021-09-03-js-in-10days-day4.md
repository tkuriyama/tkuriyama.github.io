Today's plan is, again, to make more progress on Atencio.


## Day 4 Talks / Articles


## JoJ

**Chapter 4 Functions**

- I mostly skimmed this chapter as it covers basic FP concepts. The TypeScript intro mentions that point-free style is cumbersome to annotate and not usually worthwhile with TypeScript, but it seems simple in pure JavaSCript (with implemnetations of `pipe()` and `compose()`).

- To run the `countWords` example, I had to import the node module `import fs as \`fs\``. In turn, node said that only modules can use imports, so the file needed to be a `.mjs` file instead of `.js`.


There is an interesting implemnetation of `curry`:
```javascript
const curry = fn => (...args1) =>
  args1.length === fn.length
    ? fn(...args1)
    : (...args2) => {
        const args = [...args1, ...args2]
        return args.length >= fn.length ? fn(...args) : curry(fn)(...args)
      };
```

- The property `fn.length` is a bit surprising, but it seems to work:

```javascript
> const fn = function (a, b, c) { return a + b  + c; };
undefined
> fn.length
3
```

- And the spread syntax can be used as a convenient, literal concat:

```javascript
> arr1 = [1,2,3]
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
> arr2 = [4,5,6]
[ 4, 5, 6 ]
> [...arr1, ...arr2];
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
```


**Chapter 5 Higher-Kinded Composition**

- Functors and monads in JS

- Javascript [tuple proposal((https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple) -- immutable records and tuples with the `#` prefix


- [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/): JS FP library


**Chapter 6 Modules**

-ECMA Script Modules (aka ECMA262 modules, which began as ECMA 2015 modules)

- A few prior approaches to module / context management, e.g. object namespaces ("nother common technique was to use your companyâ€™s reverse URL notation. "..!, immediately invokved function expressions (IIFE), factory functions...

- Modern JS way: use static `import` and `export` definitions

- ESM modules automatically enter in struct mode

- imports can be performed asynchronously

- `console.log(import.meta);`
