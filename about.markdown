Some thoughts from (and on) a free education in computer science and related topics.

I started journaling my journey (same etymology!) of self-study in 2013, when the first MOOCs were gaining popularity. Andrew Ng's seminal *AI* course on Coursera and Peter Norvig's *Design of Computer Programming* course on Udacity remain among my favorites to this day (though I've forgotten most of the content from Ng's class).

This blog used to be hosted on Blogger. When I decided to move to github.io, the Jekyll import function had some issues with the XML export from Blogger.... so I've left it up at [learning.tarokuriyama.com](https://learning.tarokuriyama.com).

I also occasionally make [data visualizations](https://tarokuriyama.com).
